## 📊 Sample Output & Insight

**Problem 1: Top Selling Products**

| product_name              | total_quantity_sold | total_sales_value |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Apple iMac Pro            | 126                  | 629,998.74        |
| Apple iMac 27-Inch Retina | 129                  | 232,198.71        |
| Canon EOS R5 Camera       | 57                   | 222,299.43        |

**Insight:**  
- Apple iMac Pro generated the highest sales (~$630K)  
- Premium Apple desktops dominate top revenue products  
- Professional cameras (Canon, Sony) also contribute strongly → opportunity to **cross-sell accessories**
